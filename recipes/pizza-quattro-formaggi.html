    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Pizza Dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups Italian 00 flour, (1.1 lb/500g)</li>
        <li>2 tsp fast action dried yeast, (7g)</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups lukewarm water, (320ml)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pinch pinch salt</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>semolina or regular flour, for dusting</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Toppings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 balls mozzarella, (250g)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup gorgonzola, (100g)</li>
        <li>½ cup goat cheese, (120g)</li>
        <li>½ cup parmesan, freshly grated (40g)</li>
        <li>½ cup crushed strained tomatoes, passata (200g)</li>
        <li>Black pepper, optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, put the flour, salt and yeast in a bowl making sure to put the salt and yeast at opposite sides.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the centre and add the water and olive oil. Mix it together until a rough dough forms. If it's too sticky you can gradually add a little more flour.</li>
        <li>Dust a clean work surface with a little flour and knead the dough for around 10 minutes until it's smooth and elastic. If you lightly press your finger on the ball of dough it should spring back up easily.</li>
        <li>Add 1/2 tbsp of olive oil to a large clean bowl and rub all over until the bowl is coated. Shape the dough into a ball and place in the bowl, rub the top of the dough with a tiny amount of olive oil.</li>
        <li>Cover with plastic wrap (cling film) and leave in a warm place for at least 3-4 hours or until tripled in size.</li>
        <li>Pre-heat the oven to your highest setting at least 450F/230C and add your baking trays to heat up.</li>
        <li>Cut the dough into 2 or 4 depending on how big you’d like them then either roll out on a lightly floured surface with a rolling pin or shape with your hands to fit your baking tray.</li>
        <li>Remove the baking tray from the oven and sprinkle with semolina or flour. Carefully place the pizza dough on top.</li>
        <li>Spread the pizza base evenly with tomato sauce and sprinkle with even amounts of cheese. Bake until melted, bubbling and golden (around 10-15 minutes).</li>
    </ol>
